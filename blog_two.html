      <p>
        A URL {or Uniform Resource Locator, if you are a nerd} is the website
        name followed by a line of seemingly random letters that you will find
        in the address bar. I could describe what it means, but it literally
        says it in the name – it locates resources in the form of webpages, on
        the internet. But HOW??? <br /><br />When you are attempting to access a
        webpage, the computer is looking for an IP address. However, as humans,
        we cannot memorize a series of numbers and associate them with websites.
        Thus, we use URLs instead. They basically provide a legible series of
        words so that we can understand, then does it’s own thing behind the
        scenes to find the IP address and pull up the site you are searching
        for. <br /><br />The layout of a URL is scheme/protocol, domain name, a
        top level domain, a path to the resource, and then occasionally any
        other parameters. The protocol is the part that is found at the
        beginning of the URL and is the protocol for how the browser should
        retrieve the resource. Typically, it is ‘http://’ or ‘https://’, the
        former means the information is received unencrypted, the latter meaning
        the information will be encrypted, and not easily accessed by hackers
        (and therefore secure…which is what the ‘s’ stands for). <br /><br />The
        domain shows which website is being requested by your computer. The top
        level domain {or TLD} is the “.com” that usually follows the domain
        name. This tells us about the website, like the purpose of it, or where
        it is geographically. This is usually followed by a series of forward
        slashes and numbers, which takes you to a specific page on that website
        {it is also called a subfolder or category request} and then parameters,
        which allows the webserver to do extra things before retrieving the
        resource - like sorting, tracking or filtering. Often people conflate
        links with URLs but this is not the case! Links are like spicy dynamic
        URLs, as they can be clicked. URLs are just the line of text directing
        the browser to a specific site. <br /><br />References <br />Botify.
