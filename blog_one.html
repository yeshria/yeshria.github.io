        As established in the piece, “The human mind operates through
        association.“ This is a sentence that stuck with me after the reading
        due to its increasing relevance in our everyday lives, and is a key
        concept to remember when designing and examining algorithms.
        <br /><br />
        Algorithms will never truly be able to replicate the jumbled and wild
        rabbit holes our brains go down. {For example on social media
        platforms}When looking through content suggested for you, usually after
        a while the algorithm adapts to your likes and starts suggesting content
        that you would enjoy. The catch is: it can only do this using
        information supplied by other humans as to what type of content it is.
        Is it tagged as funny? As academic? Maybe as a true crime story? Then
        the algorithm looks at how many humans interacted with this piece of
        content before deciding whether to suggest it to you or not.
        <br /><br />{To go on a mini-tangent here: it is so interesting that he
        described linking information with similar content as ‘trails’, and we
        now use the word ‘tags’. His word is more mechanically descriptive, as
        one walks down a trail in progression; which fits his mechanical idea
        for what the internet would be in his mind – a MEMEX that stores
        information in each individual’s house but with no way of communicating
        with the MEMEX’s in others houses. This kind of looks at why his
        mechanical concept is great when it comes to picturing how things should
        be stored online, but shows how it fails to adequately combine all
        knowledge into one source to draw information from} <br /><br />But what
        the MEMEX can’t do is be able to figure out how the individual
        experiences it, therefore it will never be able to suggest things based
        on how the individual feels after experiencing the content. For example,
        if I watch a true crime documentary and it ends at 1am, a suggestion
        that might come up is another true crime documentary, or perhaps another
        suspenseful film. But what the algorithm never picks up is the fact that
        since its late at night and I am paranoid, I would instead want to watch
        something light-hearted afterwards. <br /><br />However, this does not
        mean it is impossible to create an algorithm that can accomplish this in
        the future. My proposal for a future iteration of this algorithm would
        be to not only note the type of content, but other things like weather,
        time, maybe even mood if technology reaches that level, and see if there
        are patterns. This might produce a more accurate pattern-finding
        algorithm that can predict or follow a humans train of thought. Perhaps
        noticing which search results for different content types tend to follow
        each other. For example, if the user often looks at recipes online,
        followed by basic instructional videos on how to use a stove, then those
        two categories (recipes and basic instructional videos on how to use
        kitchen equipment) might have a small link. This increases each time
        this pattern is noticed. <br /><br />The idea of combining all of
        humanity’s knowledge into one easily accessible ‘MEMEX’ as Bush
        described the machine, is basically the internet today but without the
        ability to combine the knowledge and access it in every house from one
        singular source. On a side note: I believe that Bush would have
        absolutely lost his mind if he saw a personal digital planner.
