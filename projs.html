          As established in the piece, “The human mind operates through
          association.“ This is a sentence that stuck with me after the reading
          due to its increasing relevance in our everyday lives, and is a key
          concept to remember when designing and examining algorithms.

        <h6 class="blogdate">Posted: 28th March 2022</h5>
        <p>
          A URL {or Uniform Resource Locator, if you are a nerd} is the website
          name followed by a line of seemingly random letters that you will find
          in the address bar. I could describe what it means, but it literally
          says it in the name – it locates resources in the form of webpages, on
          the internet.
